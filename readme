This project has been made to practice Mongoose, Express, Node and TypeScript.

I followed a JavaScript tutorial from the Youtube french channel "Simon Dieny - Code Senior" (link below), that I "translated" into TypeScript.

GUIDE TO API USAGE

Once logged in, you will get a token valid for one hour. You will need to add an authorization header with the value "Bearer your_token" to all your requests made on the Pokemon routes.

Pokemon
    See all :    [GET]     /pokemon
    See one :    [GET]     /pokemon/:id
    Catch   :    [POST]    /pokemon           { "name": "pokemon_name" }
    Evolve  :    [PUT]     /pokemon/:id
    Delete  :    [DELETE]  /pokemon/:id
