This project has been made to practice Mongoose, Express, Node and TypeScript.

I followed a JavaScript tutorial from the Youtube french channel `Simon Dieny - Code Senior` (link below), that I "translated" into TypeScript.

*******************************************
`GUIDE TO API USAGE`

Root : `https://julienjamet-pokemon.onrender.com/api`

Trainer
    Sign up :    [POST]    /trainer/signup    { "name": `your_name`, "password": `your_password` }
    Login   :    [POST]    /trainer/login     { "name": `your_name`, "password": `your_password` }

`GUIDE TO TOKEN USAGE`

Once logged in, you will get a token valid for one hour. You will need to add an authorization header with the value "Bearer `your_token`" to all your requests made on the Pokemon routes.

Pokemon
    See all :    [GET]     /pokemon
    See one :    [GET]     /pokemon/:id
    Catch   :    [POST]    /pokemon           { "name": `pokemon_name` }
    Evolve  :    [PUT]     /pokemon/:id
    Delete  :    [DELETE]  /pokemon/:id

`GUIDE TO SEARCH QUERY USAGE`

On the `See all` route, you can configure a search query based on the type by adding "?type=`your_type`" in the URL.
For example, if you want to see all the Fire-type Pokemon you have catched, the complete URL will be :

`https://julienjamet-pokemon.onrender.com/api/pokemon?type=Feu`
