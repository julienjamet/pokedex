This project has been made from scratch to practice the MERN stack and TypeScript.

Initially, I followed a Node.js tutorial from the Youtube french channel `Simon Dieny - Code Senior` (link below), which I "translated" into TypeScript.

This tutorial inspired me to push the boundaries by creating a complete fullstack Pokedex application.

`GUIDE TO API USAGE`

Root : `https://julienjamet-pokemon.onrender.com/api`

Trainer
    Sign up :    [POST]    /trainer/signup    { "name": `your_name`, "password": `your_password` }
    Login   :    [POST]    /trainer/login     { "name": `your_name`, "password": `your_password` }

Pokemon
    See all :    [GET]     /pokemon
    See one :    [GET]     /pokemon/:id
    Catch   :    [POST]    /pokemon           { "name": `pokemon_name` }
    Evolve  :    [PUT]     /pokemon/:id
    Delete  :    [DELETE]  /pokemon/:id

`GUIDE TO SEARCH QUERY USAGE`

On the `See all` route, you can configure a search query based on the type by adding "?type=`your_type`" in the URL.
For example, if you want to see all the Fire-type Pokemon you have catched, the complete URL will be :

`https://julienjamet-pokemon.onrender.com/api/pokemon?type=feu`
